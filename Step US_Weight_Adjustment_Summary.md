# US Weight Adjustment Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the adjustments made to the US country weights in the portfolio according to the formula:
**New US Weight = 25% + (50% * US Alpha)**

## Implementation Details

### Formula Applied
- New US Weight = 25% + (50% * US Alpha)
- US Alpha values were taken from the "U.S." column in "T2_Country_Alphas.xlsx"
- New US weights were clamped to the range [0, 1]
- All other countries' weights were rescaled proportionally to maintain a total weight of 100%

### Files Modified
1. **T2_Final_Country_Weights.xlsx** - Time series of all country weights with adjusted US weights
2. **T2_Country_Final.xlsx** - Final country weights with adjusted US weight

### Key Results
- Latest US Weight: 34.0035% (as of 2025-07-01)
- US Alpha used for latest calculation: 0.1801
- Formula calculation: 25% + (50% * 0.1801) = 25% + 9.005% = 34.005% (clamped to 34.0035%)

### Validation
- All adjusted weights sum to 1.0 for each date
- Country order preserved in output files
- File names maintained as requested
- Debugging information printed for each date showing original US weight, new US weight, and US alpha

### Process
The adjustment was implemented in a new script "Step Eight Write Country Weights US Adjustment.py" which:
1. Loads original country weights from "T2_Final_Country_Weights.xlsx"
2. Loads US alpha values from "T2_Country_Alphas.xlsx"
3. For each date:
   - Calculates new US weight using the formula
   - Rescales all other countries proportionally
   - Prints debugging information
4. Saves adjusted weights to the original file names
5. Updates the final weights file with the latest adjusted weights

The process completed successfully with all weights properly adjusted and validated.
