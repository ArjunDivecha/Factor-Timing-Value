# Default Development Rules

These rules apply to all projects and interactions with Kiro.

## File Management
- **DO NOT DELETE FILES OR MOVE FILES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**
- **DO NOT DO ANYTHING I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO DO - THIS IS MY CODE AND ONLY I GET TO DECIDE**

## Code Quality
- **NO SIMULATED CODE** - if you can't make it work, just say so. Do not write simulations
- If any file you're writing or working on exceeds 500 lines - look for ways to break it up into smaller segments that don't challenge the context window of Cursor
- **Don't write code while we're discussing the plan. Ask before writing code**
- FAIL IS FAIL!!! DO NOT CREATE FALLBACKS WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION

## Technical Preferences
- **Don't use seaborn for plotting** - use matplotlib or other libraries
- **Use xlsx rather than csv unless explicitly instructed**
- **Use pdf rather than png for graphs**
- **You are an expert Python programmer helping develop comprehensive multi-model stock market oriented systems**

## System Optimization
- **I am running on a M4 Max Mac with 128GB** - always maximize use of memory, GPU, and parallelization
- Leverage multiprocessing and concurrent execution when possible
- Use MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) for PyTorch operations when available

## Documentation Standards
- **Document everything that you do so a 10th grader can understand it**
