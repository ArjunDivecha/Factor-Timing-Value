    "STRATEGY OVERVIEW:\n",
    "This module implements an adaptive factor rotation strategy that dynamically allocates \n",
    "capital among country factors based on their recent performance characteristics. Unlike \n",
    "traditional static allocation approaches, this strategy actively shifts exposure between \n",
    "factors as market regimes change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Strategy Components:\n",
    "1. Multi-metric Factor Scoring System:\n",
    "   - Momentum: Captures directional strength by measuring recent factor returns\n",
    "   - Hit Rate: Evaluates consistency by calculating the percentage of positive months\n",
    "   - Risk-adjusted Performance: Incorporates Sharpe ratio to balance return and volatility\n",
    "   - Combined Score: Multiplicative combination that rewards factors with strong, \n",
    "     consistent, and risk-efficient performance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Adaptive Lookback Period:\n",
    "   - Tests multiple lookback windows (3m to 60m) to identify optimal signal horizon\n",
    "   - Demonstrates the trade-off between signal responsiveness and stability\n",
    "   - Longer lookbacks (36m) produce higher Sharpe ratios but lower turnover\n",
    "   - Shorter lookbacks (3m-12m) react faster to changing market conditions but with higher turnover\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Concentration Control:\n",
    "   - Selects top 3 factors with positive scores to maintain diversification\n",
    "   - Implements position size caps to prevent excessive concentration\n",
    "   - Weights factors proportionally to their Sharpe ratios rather than equal weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Characteristics:\n",
    "- The 36-month lookback version achieves a Sharpe ratio of 0.64 with reasonable turnover\n",
    "- The strategy demonstrates strong downside protection during market drawdowns\n",
    "- Longer lookback periods exhibit more stability and lower turnover, suitable for institutional portfolios\n",
    "- Shorter lookback periods provide more tactical exposure with higher responsiveness to market shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversification Benefits:\n",
    "- Factor timing provides different return streams compared to static allocations\n",
    "- The approach can complement traditional geographic or sector diversification\n",
    "- Adaptive weighting helps navigate changing macro environments that impact factor performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation Considerations:\n",
    "- Monthly rebalancing to balance trading costs against signal decay\n",
    "- Transaction cost modeling incorporated into the evaluation framework\n",
    "- Careful factor selection to avoid excessive correlation among signals\n",
