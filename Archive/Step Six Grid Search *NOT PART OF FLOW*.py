Factor Timing Strategy Grid Search - Step Six (Archive - Not Part of Main Flow)

=============================================================================
INPUT FILES:
- T2_Optimizer.xlsx: Excel file containing factor returns data with dates in first column and factor returns as percentages in subsequent columns
- Step Factor Categories.xlsx: Excel file with factor filtering criteria containing columns "Factor Name" and "Max" (where Max=1 indicates factors to include)

OUTPUT FILES:
- Terminal display only: Three grids showing annualized returns, Sharpe ratios, and monthly turnover for different factor/lookback combinations
- No files are written to disk by this program

=============================================================================

WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES:
This program helps find the best combination of two important settings for our factor timing strategy:
1. How many top factors to use (1, 3, 5, 7, 10, or 15 factors)
2. How far back to look when evaluating factors (24, 36, 60, 72, or 90 months)

The program tests all 30 possible combinations (6 factor counts Ã— 5 lookback periods) and shows you:
- Which combination gives the highest returns
- Which combination has the best risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)
- How much trading each combination requires (turnover)

IMPORTANT: Only factors marked with Max=1 in the Factor Categories file are used.
Factors marked with Max=0 are completely ignored.

The program displays three tables in the terminal showing performance for each combination,
making it easy to identify the optimal settings for the factor timing strategy.

    Run the factor timing strategy with specific settings to see how it performs.
    
    WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES:
    This function implements our factor timing strategy. Each month, it:
    1. Looks back at the specified number of months of factor performance
    2. Calculates a score for each factor based on momentum, hit rate, and Sharpe ratio
    3. Selects the top N factors with positive scores
    4. Weights them based on their 12-month trailing returns (higher returns get more weight)
    5. Returns the strategy performance and position history
    
    INPUTS:
    - excel_path: Full path to the Excel file with factor returns data
    - n_top_factors: How many top factors to select each month (default: 3)

    - strategy_returns: Monthly returns of the strategy as a pandas Series
    - positions: DataFrame showing which factors were selected and their weights each month
    - factor_scores: DataFrame showing the calculated scores for all factors over time
    
    The strategy only invests in factors with positive scores and weights them by their
    12-month trailing returns rather than equal weighting.
